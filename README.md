# Michael Evans | CS-499 ePortfolio

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Hello, my name is Michael Evans, and I have been pursuing a Computer Science degree at SNHU. This electronic portfolio showcases the work of my final project for CS-499. Completing this capstone project marks the end of an important chapter in my academic journey, culminating in the achievement of my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have gained during my studies and reflect my readiness to enter the field as a software engineer. I start by doing a code review of an old project. I then improve the project in three key areas shown below.

## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout my journey in the Computer Science program, I have significantly sharpened my technical capabilities while learning to align my work with both industry expectations and my long-term career goals. One of the most impactful aspects of this experience has been developing my ePortfolioâ€”a tool that not only showcases my skills but also reflects the depth of my growth as a software engineer. This collection of work was instrumental in helping me secure a position as a Junior Software Engineer at Liberty Mutual, a milestone that marks the beginning of my professional career.

Through rigorous coursework, Iâ€™ve adopted modern best practices for writing clean, maintainable code, strengthened my ability to solve complex problems using efficient algorithms and data structures, and deepened my understanding of key concepts such as database architecture, application security, and scalable system design. These skills have allowed me to build real-world applications with confidence and clarity.

While much of my academic work was completed independently, Iâ€™ve also come to recognize the critical role of collaboration and clear communicationâ€”particularly when building secure, user-friendly software in fast-paced environments. Each artifact in my ePortfolio reflects a deliberate effort to create thoughtful, strategic, and technically sound solutions. I believe this portfolio not only illustrates my technical competence, but also highlights my readiness to contribute meaningfully to professional software teams and to continue learning and growing in the field.

## Pre-Update Code Review

Here lies a review of the code for the project I will be working on. It reviews the codebase as it was before the 3 artifact improvements : [Click Me](https://youtu.be/1Rih6nK-rag)

## Artifact 1 : Software Design and Engineering

For this enhancement, I transformed a basic budgeting tool into a full-stack mobile-first application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node.js). The improvements include:

- Modular API architecture
- Secure JWT authentication
- Responsive mobile UI design
- Full CRUD support for budget items
- State-managed charts and user feedback

These updates demonstrate my ability to develop scalable, user-friendly software that meets real-world usability needs.

## Artifact 2 : Algorithms and Data Structures

This enhancement focused on application logic improvements, including:

- Refactored state and filtering logic for real-time updates
- Optimized category breakdown calculations
- Added performance-conscious list rendering and conditional handling

The result is a system that remains responsive and scalable even with larger datasets. These improvements showcase practical problem-solving and performance optimization with JavaScript data structures and array methods.

## Artifact 3 : Databases

The third enhancement focused on database improvements:

- Restructured MongoDB schemas for validation and extensibility
- Improved query performance with indexing
- Added concurrency safety to CRUD operations
- Hardened API endpoints with input sanitation and role-based access

This refined the integrity and reliability of the systemâ€™s backend, allowing it to scale more effectively and remain secure under concurrent usage.
