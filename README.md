# Michael Evans | CS-499 ePortfolio

## ðŸ“˜ Introduction
Hello, my name is Michael Evans, and I have been pursuing a Computer Science degree at SNHU. This electronic portfolio showcases the work of my final project for CS-499. Completing this capstone project marks the end of an important chapter in my academic journey, culminating in the achievement of my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science.

Through this portfolio, I aim to demonstrate the skills and knowledge I have gained during my studies and reflect my readiness to enter the field as a software engineer. I start by doing a code review of an old project. I then improve the project in three key areas stated in the table of contents below.

## ðŸ§  Professional Self-Assessment

Over the course of my studies in the Computer Science program, I have honed my technical skills and learned how to present my work in ways that reflect my professional goals and values. Developing my ePortfolio has been a pivotal experience in showcasing my strengths and demonstrating my readiness to advance in the field.

Through ongoing coursework, Iâ€™ve adopted best practices for writing maintainable code, refined my approach to solving complex problems with data structures and algorithms, and gained a deeper understanding of databases, security, and scalable system design.

While much of my work has been completed independently, I have learned to value collaboration and communicationâ€”especially in the context of building software thatâ€™s secure, efficient, and usable. These ePortfolio artifacts represent how Iâ€™ve grown as a developer and how Iâ€™ve learned to build solutions that are thoughtful, strategic, and user-centered.

## Pre-Update Code Review

Here lies a review of the code for the project I will be working on. It reviews the codebase as it was before the 3 artifact improvements : Click Me [https://youtu.be/1Rih6nK-rag]

## Artifact 1 : Software Design and Engineering

For this enhancement, I transformed a basic budgeting tool into a full-stack mobile-first application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React Native, Node.js). The improvements include:

- Modular API architecture
- Secure JWT authentication
- Responsive mobile UI design
- Full CRUD support for budget items
- State-managed charts and user feedback

These updates demonstrate my ability to develop scalable, user-friendly software that meets real-world usability needs.

## Artifact 2 : Algorithms and Data Structures

This enhancement focused on application logic improvements, including:

- Refactored state and filtering logic for real-time updates
- Optimized category breakdown calculations
- Added performance-conscious list rendering and conditional handling

The result is a system that remains responsive and scalable even with larger datasets. These improvements showcase practical problem-solving and performance optimization with JavaScript data structures and array methods.

## Artifact 3 : Databases

The third enhancement focused on database improvements:

- Restructured MongoDB schemas for validation and extensibility
- Improved query performance with indexing
- Added concurrency safety to CRUD operations
- Hardened API endpoints with input sanitation and role-based access

This refined the integrity and reliability of the systemâ€™s backend, allowing it to scale more effectively and remain secure under concurrent usage.
